Tensorflow and Keras need to be installed to run this code
The dataset used for this project was the FLAME dataset using the Training and Test sets
This datasets can be accesed by affiliates of Essex University using 
https://essexuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/hr17576_essex_ac_uk/EplQh6rwA8pJhHP0jKfg6-kBVHyb1BE9TCAj4MVR0tyOEA

The "directory" needs to be changed to the location of the Training Folder
The DataProcessing code loads the data, divides it into Training and Validation 
and displays the output of loading, applying data augmentation to a frame and to the complete dataset
